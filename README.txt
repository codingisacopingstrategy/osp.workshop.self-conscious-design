What is here
------------

In the git repository, we track the uncompressed versions of the eBooks.
You can find them in the folder: public/epub_content

To view the eBooks, run the following command in the terminal:

    python app.py

And visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

(Dependencies: Python, Flask)

Components
----------

The ePub reader uses readium.js, a BSD-licensed eReading element. We started from their
example implementation, readium-viewer: https://github.com/readium/readium-js-viewer
