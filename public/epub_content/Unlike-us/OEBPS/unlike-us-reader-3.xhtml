			<p>What we usually call ‘social networks’ – a paradoxical appellation, as we shall see, – lie at the core of what constitutes the social.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-1-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-1">1</a></sup> The appellation itself is paradoxical since we are talking here about digital networks which appear to shortcut the traditional networks of proximity that have defined what is social from times immemorial. And we will easily admit that they are core to the social when following Aristotle who said that they pertain to the <em>philia</em>, itself the fundament of the social.</p>
			<p>Aristotle tells us – and all traditions currently in vogue, including Jacques Derrida in <em>The Politics of Friendship</em> follow him in this respect – that friendship (i.e. <em>philia</em>) is the paramount social link without which society would not exist. Jean Lauxerois, however, strongly disagreed with translating <em>philia</em> with <em>friendship</em>. I did not follow him, initially. But reflecting on social networks I ended up seeing that he was right:<sup><a id="footnote-294455-2-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-2">2</a></sup></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="unordered-list"><span class="bullet">–</span> Firstly because there is actually a Greek word for friendship: ‘philotès’,</li>
				<li class="unordered-list-last"><span class="bullet">–</span> Secondly because Aristotle states that each and every <em>animated living being</em> partakes in a <em>philia</em> with its kin.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-3-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-3">3</a></sup></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="quote"><em>Philia</em>, writes Lauxerois, is more than mere friendship the way we understand it. It designates the way every living being, whether human or animal, is by necessity bound to other living beings from the moment he or she comes to the world.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-4-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-4">4</a></sup></p>
			<p><em>Philia</em> was according to Aristotle what bonded humans, yet humans, again according to Aristotle, represented only one particular case of philia.</p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>In order to clarify this first point, especially where we would like to enquire whether new forms of friendship arise through what we call social networks, or more generally, new forms of <em>philia</em>, I suggest we make a detour in the company of Jacob von Uexküll. His <em>description</em> includes one aspect of animal <em>philia</em> as the fundamentally open possibility of <em>adoption</em>: </p>
			<p class="quote">Gregarious jackdaws have around them their entire lives a “companion” [“<em>socius</em>”] with whom they undertake all sorts of actions. Even if a jackdaw is brought up alone, it does not go without the companion but, if it cannot find one of its own species, it takes on a “substitute companion,” and, in fact, a new substitute companion can fill that gap for each new activity.</p>
			<p class="quote">In its youth, the jackdaw Tschock had [his owner] Lorenz himself as its mother-companion. It followed him all over the place; it called to him when it wanted to be fed. Once it had learned to get its own feed, it chose the maid as its companion and performed the characteristic courtship dance in front of her. Later, it found a young jackdaw which became its adoptive companion and which Tschock fed. Whenever Tschock prepared for a longer flight, it attempted to persuade Lorenz to fly with it in typical jackdaw fashion, by flying straight up just behind his back. When that did not work, it joined flying crows, who then became its flight companions [“<em>socii</em>”].<sup><a id="footnote-294455-5-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-5">5</a></sup></p>
			<p>According to Lauxerois, Aristotle states:</p>
			<p class="quote"><em>philia</em> should be regarded as pertaining both to animals of the same sort, say birds, as to members of the same family – but also to the relationships that obtain between and within different human communities – like city-states.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-6-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-6">6</a></sup></p>
			<p>Now, if it is possible for jackdaws to adopt living beings who are not fellow species as equal to themselves, we must ask ourselves what it is <em>exactly</em> that constitutes the <em>philia</em> of <em>those who can become friends</em>. By friends we mean those beings who can be <em>affected by love, desire, and absence</em> – of which the desired object (conceptualized by Lacan as ‘le manque’, ‘the lack’) is always an experience. And from there, to <em>individuate themselves in this affection</em>, by which they become <em>psychically</em> individuated, and in that, <em>singularly affected</em>.</p>
			<p>In Simondon’s terms, this issue pertains to the passage of <em>vital</em> individuation to <em>psychical and collective</em> individuation. Vital individuation, writes Simondon:</p>
			<p class="quote">[…] can take place either at the level of an individual being, or through the organic relationship which exists between different beings. In the latter case, internal integration within the individual being is augmented with and by external integration: the group functions as integrator. Vital unity constitutes then the sole concrete reality, and this can consist in some cases of a single individual, and in others of a very differentiated group of multiple individuals.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-7-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-7">7</a></sup></p>
			<p>In a note, Simondon goes on to describe the very specific <em>philia</em> of the white ants:</p>
			<p class="quote">Despite their rather simple neuronal constitution, white ants build the most elaborate structures found in the animal world: working as a group, they act as if they were one single organism.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-8-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-8">8</a></sup></p>
			<p>We must therefore think in terms of vital <em>individuation as a process</em>, rather than in terms of (the nature of) living individuals:</p>
			<p class="quote">What in biology is called an individual is actually a sub-individual rather than an individual; it is as if in biology, individuality should be seen as having many layers, depending on successive levels of individuation […] Not the single individual, but the group as a whole should be regarded as the vital unit.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-9-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-9">9</a></sup></p>
			<p>Individuation seen this way results in another conception of <em>philia</em>, and of what is tentatively understood under this term. It relates to the grouping together of (all kinds of) plant or animal life, of cells agglomerating into one body, corals, colonies of all sorts, herds, gangs, pairs of animals – all this would typically result in vital individuation in relation to physical individuation.</p>
			<p>But vital individuation consists in a banding together of individuals without becoming a community plagued by a <em>community deficit</em> which, according to George Bataille, is the hallmark of those who are susceptible to friendship – the deficit of community where psychical phenomena arise which belong to what Canguilhelm called technical life, with another word: humans. Contrary to psychical and collective, or social individuation, vital individuation is <em>always a bonding, and with no possibility of disjunction other than a teratological one or one caused from outside</em>.</p>
			<p>And, as opposed to this vital individuation, psychical and collective individuation, at the same time, fit and unfit the community of those who are bereft of a community, meaning an individuation that is at the same time always <em>augmented</em> yet also <em>diminished</em> by technical individuation – that is the individuation of the sort of beings that we are, or at least try to be, or that we believe to be in our attempt to share a common future, a future which we would like to be friendly, or which we would like to be able to believe to be friendly, especially with regard to the expansion of what we call ‘social networks’ – psychical and collective individuation becomes, contrarily to vital individuation, an <em>alteration</em>: a <em>becoming-other</em>, in the presence of the other, of the big Other, that is, existing under the condition which Freud first, and then Lacan, called <em>das Ding</em>.</p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>Whatever may be said about these translation issues – and whatever may be said about the precise difference between <em>philia</em> and <em>philotès</em>, between <em>philia</em> as animal adoption and <em>philia</em> as human adoption, within which friendship, in the sense of <em>philotès</em>, would be only a specific instance – in order to be part of a social network which originated in <em>social engineering,</em><sup><a id="footnote-294455-10-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-10">10</a></sup> meaning the sophisticated relational technologies that are ‘social networks’, one should first describe what this relational technology calls your ‘network of friends’ – ‘friends’ which should be better understood in the sense of ‘contacts’, not even ‘acquaintances’, but rather addressees and carriers of one’s ‘reputation’, by way of the <em>network effect of networks</em> which makes the ‘friends’ of my ‘friends’ automatically my ‘friends’.</p>
			<p>We should also enquire here about these <em>reputation technologies</em> – which according to Howard Rheingold are sophisticated relational technologies of social engineering – by taking what the (ancient) Greeks called the <em>kleos</em><sup><a id="footnote-294455-11-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-11">11</a></sup> as our starting point. Kleos is variously translated as reputation, glory, posterity, rumor, etc., but we lack room and time here to pursue this further. And another very pressing issue would be to analyze how this ‘network effect’ precisely affects this type of ‘network of networks’ which, I would think, does nicely correspond to what Aristotle understood as <em>philia</em> amongst mortal, noetic beings, also known by moderns as ‘humans’. </p>
			<p>The <em>description</em> of one’s ‘network of friends’ such as is demanded by the relational technology of social networks requires that one formally includes other members of the network in one’s own network, themselves having therefore also agreed with this declarative and descriptive procedure. By (formally) declaring our ‘friends’ and our ‘friendship’, and also operating a selection among our <em>friends, acquaintances, and contacts of all sorts</em>, here all lumped together under the appellation ‘friends’, we trigger a profound alteration under <em>what used to be understood as social networks:</em> friends, family and relatives, acquaintances, chums, pals, old social structures, the very ones <em>creating</em> those networks and <em>depending</em> on them at the same time, etc.</p>
			<p>And thus we were already included in these social networks, but without really realizing it so much. But now we see ourselves drawn into these relational technologies, which suddenly leads us to make them explicit, and at the same time to profoundly change them, and sometimes even to abandon them altogether with regard to those whom we now call our friends. Therefore, I think we should consider them rather as the sort of <em>philia</em> we see amongst animals, like Tschock the jackdaw or white ants in their anthills. I am repeating here an hypothesis already voiced in my book <em>De la Misère Symbolique 1 </em>where I suggest that digital technologies, in so far as they generalize traceability, could well return humanity’s behavior to the level of synchronized arthropods moving around under the sway of the chemical pheromones emitted continuously by all members of the colony. </p>
			<p>It is here that the translation issue raised by Lauxerois would take its full meaning: are digital, also known as social, networks a <em>philia</em> regressing us to the state of insects, or do they constitute a novel opportunity to achieve this elusive <em>philotès</em> among humans? And in order to dramatize the issue even further, let us look at what Aristotle had to say about what <em>philia</em> is when it is human:</p>
			<p class="quote"><em>Philia</em> is the most necessary thing in life, since nobody would choose to live without it, even in the possession of all other goods.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-12-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-12">12</a></sup></p>
			<p>Here, Aristotle is crystal clear: among humans, and in its manifestation as friendship, philia <em>is the most precious good</em>. It is the most precious good for <em>individual</em> human beings, because <em>without it, life is not worth living</em>.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-13-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-13">13</a></sup> </p>
			<p>But it is also the most precious good for <em>societies</em> for the simple reason that it constitutes their very basic feature, as linking power, which also means as power to create the solidarity that spawns relational threads, or in other words, social networks.</p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>These friends – whose chance encounter makes us so happy, just as the unexpected things that arise from the encounter, like Bouvard meeting Pecuchet on a bench – these friends then, and the networks that form <em>around</em> them and <em>thanks</em> <em>to</em> them, are precisely what the Facebook entry procedures demand from us to <em>declare</em>, before any relation can be established, but also<em> only after we have duly given our email address and chosen a password</em>. It is thus in no way different from making a statement at the police station – it is a <em>formalization</em>, <em>a publication</em>, in the sense of making public.</p>
			<p>Such a construct whereby friendship is <em>declared, formalized, </em>and<em> made public</em> invites many, many questions – including ones on its perfectly performative character: if one declares someone to be one’s friend, one in a certain sense <em>makes</em> him or her a friend, and <em>forces</em> her or him to be one. Yet it would seem that if there is something essential to a friendship-based relationship, it is precisely to <em>escape</em> formalization and publicity, but on the contrary to contribute to the existence of a group of what is called <em>intimi</em>, people one is intimate with, or, more broadly speaking, the circle of <em>familiar faces</em>. ‘No fuss between us’ is typically something one says when establishing the bonds of friendship, switching for instance from the polite to the informal address, as promptly do Bouvard and Pecuchet after their chance encounter.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-14-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-14">14</a></sup></p>
			<p>However, maybe the situation is still more complex in nature, as I will try to show. Maybe friendships always carried with them a public, if not an explicit, declaration, precisely because friendship very often lies at the origin of a social network. Such a social network could be very small, and the public declaration could even have a more narrowly limited reach pertaining to the most intimate of relationships, constituting what Lacan called the <em>extime</em> (‘exteem’).<sup><a id="footnote-294455-15-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-15">15</a></sup></p>
			<p>Now, besides all these considerations, what is Facebook actually, apart from the fact that it is, as Alain Seban has mentioned, a social network that has grown at a rate of ten million a month since the beginning of this year and will pass hundred million users after August 25?<sup><a id="footnote-294455-16-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-16">16</a></sup> Well, to start with the beginning, as one says informally, that is to say among friends, and to say so in a non-Aristotelian language: Facebook has a mode of functioning based on two features:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="numbered-list"><span>1.</span> <em>creating a profile</em>, which amounts to a kind of <em>self-description through one’s relations</em>,</li>
				<li class="numbered-list-last"><span>2.</span> <em>dialogue</em>, which constitutes a process <em>of sociation in terms of collective individuation</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>Everybody is aware of the fact that the profiling feature is problematic insofar as it is nowadays being made use of by advertisers to target ‘potentials’ in the most precise way possible – let’s call that surgical marketing.</p>
			<p>The <em>self</em>-profiling function could of course be an <em>exercise in reflexivity</em> for the person practicing it, but it has as principal effect to bring the new member of this type of network to declare his or her social belonging as if he or she were an ethnographer, and to thereby engage, if not in <em>auto-ethnography</em>, then at least in an <em>auto-sociography</em> by declaring and writing his or her network attachments – especially concerning friendships, but also interests of all kinds, including the most trivial and venal ones – all through a <em>digital script mechanism</em>. </p>
			<p>I do believe that this self-indexation feature could be of major <em>social significance</em>, and could even trigger a <em>renewal</em> of social life – which is in bad shape by the way, we can’t deny that much. I do believe that the reflexivity included in the public declaration of relationships (friendly and otherwise) could lead, if intelligently put to work by communities and collective intelligence networks like Facebook and others, to the emergence of a process of psychical, collective and technical individuation, which would indeed make for a <em>relationally peaceful</em> or benevolent 21st century, grounded in – if I dare to say – a new benevolence (i.e. goodwill), even if it would not be ‘friendly’ in the strict sense of the term.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-17-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-17">17</a></sup></p>
			<p>Others would probably say that the social is not in very good shape precisely <em>be&#173;-cause of these technologies</em> which destroy it at the same time as they <em>formalize</em> it. So it may be. Such a mechanism indeed allows for meta-formalizations, the extraction of rules, but also of computations, which would lead to a computation-imposed destruction of existence – whereas friendship always supersedes such computations, hence the ‘no fuss between us’, (meaning no trucks involving money, no cunning moves big or small, the reason why one often hears that ‘in business there are no friends’, etc.).</p>
			<p>These cunning, considered moves, when they are made for the sake of sociological or anthropological research, form the mainstay of John Barnes’ theory of <em>social networks</em>.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-18-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-18">18</a></sup> Claude Lévi-Strauss went down the same road in order to research and structurally formalize the social relations within the Nambikwara tribe, where he took the opportunity arising from an incident to trick the tribe’s little girls into telling their names – names which <em>ought to have remained</em> <em>secret</em>:</p>
			<p class="quote">One day, when I was playing with a group of children, a little girl was struck by one of her comrades. She ran to me for protection and began to whisper something, a “great secret”, in my ear. As I did not understand I had to ask her to repeat it over and over again. Eventually her adversary found out what was going on, came up to me in a rage, and tried in her turn to tell me what seemed to be another secret. After a little while I was able to get to the bottom of the incident. The first little girl was trying to tell me her enemy’s name, and when the enemy found out what was going on she decided to tell me the other girl’s name, by way of reprisal. Thenceforward it was easy enough, though not very scrupulous, to egg the children on, one against the other, till in time I knew all of their names. When this was completed and we were all, in a sense, one another’s accomplices, I soon got them to give me the adult’s names too. When this was discovered, the children were reprimanded and my sources of information dried up.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-19-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-19">19</a></sup></p>
			<p>It is from such anthropological descriptions exploring the hidden relationships instrumental in the establishment of social relations – one could also mention here the works of Benjamin Lee Whorf, who formalized the grammar of the Hopi Indians, very much against their wish<sup><a id="footnote-294455-20-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-20">20</a></sup> – that we may arrive at a better understanding of the social as a <em>set of relational rules</em>, and even be able to make it more dense, to strengthen, as it were, the modalities of the exercise of the <em>philia</em>.</p>
			<p>And now I am coming to believe that the same kind of descriptions, if done through this system of auto-anthropology that is a social network like Facebook, could also lead to a form of reflexive individuation.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-21-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-21">21</a></sup> But if so, under what conditions?</p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>It is through <em>science</em>, be it anthropology or linguistics, or law – since law is what formalizes social rules – that we should arrive at a kind of reflexive <em>philia</em>, which could be understood as the hallmark of <em>political</em> societies. Political societies arose with the Greek <em>polis</em>, which was grounded in public law, itself declared, described, and made explicit according to a strict set of rules in the sense that they were grounded in citizenship as a <em>formally constituted friendship bond, which itself was formally declared and based on public law</em> which was simply the entry condition into a social group called <em>polis</em>, and then <em>civitas</em>, and finally nation. This, of course, is a network of networks itself also grounded in a technology that makes relations explicit, namely writing.</p>
			<p>In fact, nowadays, the arrival of a new member of the community, commonly called birth, must <em>absolutely and always</em> lead to a declaration to a registrar (of birth and death), who at the same time formalizes a <em>family</em> network by putting it down in writing. These written and hence formal archives accompany a person, in circumstances happy or unfortunate, for the time of his or her life. There would be no historians without them.</p>
			<p>Writing is a mnemotechnic for formalizing relationships. It starts with the most elementary relational organ all humans share: the language. This is why the Hopis didn’t want their language to be grammatized: they knew it would destroy their very culture.</p>
			<p>And yet, wouldn’t Hopi society, which so fascinated Aby Warburg, have had a better future if anthropology had been able to offer another modality of grammatization, that is, a discretized formalization of its relational flows – the kind of flows through which social networks arise which constitute a social group?</p>
			<p>Whatever is the case, it is clear that citizenship forming is grounded on the descriptive grammatization of social relationships by way of the written script in the service of an intensification of the psychical individuation of each citizen, and through him of her, of the other citizens, leading by progressive extension, to collective individuation. This in turn leads to a particular process of <em>trans-individuation</em>, which simply amounts to the <em>writing of history</em>, itself leading to the <em>specific social dynamic</em> which we call the Occident. </p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>I call a <em>process of trans-individuation</em> that which ensures that during the course of a social relationship, something that is always, in Simondon’s words, an assemblage of psychical individuations socially co-individuating<em> </em>each other (and not only in the psychical sense), and this through processes of dual <em>co-individuation</em>,<sup><a id="footnote-294455-22-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-22">22</a></sup> meaning individuation <em>by two people at a time,</em><sup><a id="footnote-294455-23-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-23">23</a></sup> of which friendship and love are exquisite and necessary instances for the formation of the psychical individual (reason why childhood friendships are so important, and why Wilhelm Meister’s friendship fascinates us so much), a process of <em>meta-stabilization</em> exists, during this co-individuation, which leads it towards what would be called in neuronal network theory an <em>attractor</em>, through which a certain type of relations gets built up as <em>norm</em>. </p>
			<p>This implies that <em>trans-individuation is not simple co-individuation</em>: it is what is bound to become the <em>rule</em> of the network, a rule more efficient as it is unconscious most of the time. Such a trans-individuation results in what Simondon calls the trans-individual, and the trans-individual is what meta-stabilizes meanings.</p>
			<p>Meanings make for a world by giving it an understanding shared by those who <em>individuate and co-individuate themselves</em> in it by making its meaning evolve, thereby transforming what was a simple <em>network</em> in a true <em>world</em>, within which a process of collective and psychical individuation is triggered among those who form this network-world, and bonds them together under the seal of friendship, that is with the force of the bonds constituting friendship.</p>
			<p>So if the written script constitutes an individuation regime which allows for the intensification of the evolution that is collective individuation by enhancing psychical individuation and thereby strengthening the social bond, it can also lead, as Michel Foucault has shown, to a process of <em>subjectivation</em>, which actually is a <em>sujétion</em>, or submission, leading in turn to de-subjectification and <em>disindividuation</em>.</p>
			<p>This is particularly true of what Foucault termed disciplinary societies, where the power not only ‘files’ all behaviors, but also <em>documentalizes</em> individuals in order to submit their whole life, in all its aspects, to control by way of writing. This is what Foucault called bio-power (‘<em>biopouvoir</em>’).</p>
			<p>Characteristic of the bio-power is the test – school-test or health-check – which is foremost a disciplinary and a surveillance technique. As Foucault states, ‘The examination also introduces individuality into the field of documentation […] The examination that places individuals in a field of surveillance also situates them in a network of writing; it engages them in a whole mass of documents that capture and fix them’,<sup><a id="footnote-294455-24-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-24">24</a></sup> and which constitutes also a ‘power of writing’.</p>
			<p>Now, even if the ‘Edvige’-project<sup><a id="footnote-294455-25-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-25">25</a></sup> reminded us of something already noted in the Nora-Minc report<sup><a id="footnote-294455-26-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-26">26</a></sup> on the informatization of society, namely digitization and the ensuing traceability – the expansion of what the authors propose to call ‘telematics’ – represent a considerable risk to individual and collective liberties, the <em>big issue, the truly new issue</em>, is not so much about <em>state and police control</em>, but about the control which <em>marketing</em> attempts to exercise on behaviors through the set-up of systems of self-description of social relations. If inclined to pessimism, one might fear that they inevitably will lead to a new form of computer-assisted, self-inflicted slavery – a digital anthill.</p>
			<p>In which case we will face something greater than a bio-power: a psycho-power, or to be even more precise,<sup><a id="footnote-294455-27-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-27">27</a></sup> a psycho-socio-power.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-28-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-28">28</a></sup></p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>I must immediately clarify that I am not out to simply reduce social networks to police instruments, nor to simple marketing instruments. Neither am I out to demonize police or marketing as such.</p>
			<p>I rather would like to show that <em>social networks represent a stage within a process of grammati</em>z<em>ation</em>, which leads to the <em>grammatization of social relations </em>as such. I call grammatization the process of formalization and discretization which permits, on one hand, the reproduction of what is discretized, and on the other, operations, of computing or control, and finally, a reflexivity, or critique, of what can be iterated, and which, by way of its iteration, is able to produce a difference, meaning also an individuation, meaning then again, a difference.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-29-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-29">29</a></sup></p>
			<p>Now, being a grammatization of social relations, like all grammatizations, social networks are a <em>pharmacologic</em> phenomenon because they allow both for disindividuation as well as for the intensification of individuation.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-30-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-30">30</a></sup> This is where the dialogue function on Facebook should be helpful – if only trans-individuation applications were installed on it, something that, as far as I know at present, is entirely lacking.</p>
			<p>Social networks are therefore essential components of what Deleuze called control and modulation societies – and they push them further forward. But let us not forget that Deleuze sometimes speculated about an <em>art of the control</em>, and that his primary concern was not to do away with control, but <em>to do something</em> with it – if not to take control of it. The fact that social networks make disindividuation worse, not so much through police control, but through the behavioral control exercised by marketing, represents a possible disindividuation which <em>could</em> be countered, but only if one is able to <em>reverse the pharmacologic direction of social networks</em>.</p>
			<p>All this is not about preventing or denying the existence of social networks, or ignoring the dangers they represent. It is foremost about inventing the future of social networks, <em>in</em> social networks, and <em>with</em> social networks. But this is only possible if we are able to arrive at an understanding of these networks which are <em>at the same time</em> technological and social, and to attain such an understanding as to make these networks capable of becoming <em>agents of reflexivity</em> – for instance as agents of the reflexive modernity Ulrich Beck invoked more than twenty years ago, after the Chernobyl catastrophe.</p>

			<p>I just used the word <em>catastrophe</em>, a word that has become commonplace these days, yet should not be used in vain. All the same, and before proceeding any further, I would like to posit here that if Chernobyl was a great catastrophe (and in the meanwhile we also have witnessed the catastrophe at Fukushima), we now discover many more catastrophes, all inviting us to think about other mediations regarding this ‘reflexive modernity’, or, to use a more open formula, to think about <em>a new industrial civilization</em>, something which would drag us out of our seemingly present state of <em>industrial decadence</em>.</p>
			<p>Here, I am thinking more specifically about catastrophes that are psychical, social, and also those between generations, something young people suffer more and more from due to the slow, but undeniable, erosion of the social networks which existed before the <em>digital social networks</em>, like the family, school, neighbors, citizenship, mediating organizations, etc. </p>
			<p>This erosion comes as the consequence of the excessive influence of psycho-power buttressed by psycho-technologies which multiply all kinds of networks. The worst culprit, I think, is the television network, which short-cuts the <em>traditional social network</em>, the one which, by virtue of its inter-generational nature, for millennia took care of a <em>familiar reticularity</em>, that <em>philia</em> without which no society can exist, and which has led to a kind of psychical and at the same time collective disindividuation. </p>
			<p>Thus, beyond these <em>psycho-technologies</em>, <em>socio-technologies</em>, or rather, psycho-socio-technologies appear together with social networks. I have shown elsewhere how, in our very complex times, this disindividuation goes together with a destruction of inter-generational bonds, and also with a technology of massive capturing of psychical attention.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-31-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-31">31</a></sup> </p>
			<p>Yet, as one knows, attention is not only a psychical, but also a social thing. Social attention means civility, urbanity, the common politeness whose name is derived from <em>polis</em>, that is politics in its most friendly and peaceful garb possible. For so far it is true that the opposite of a friend is a foe, and that the common relationship amongst foes is war.</p>
			<p>The gambit of social networks constituting the digital grammatization of the social – which of course goes together with metadata technologies and innumerable other facets of the formalization of trans-individuation processes – is the mutation we should achieve regarding putting to work techniques of formation and the capture of psychical as well as of social attention, in the form of relational technologies.</p>
			<p>My fundamental thesis on these issues in general is, that precisely what creates processes of disindividuation, that is of the destruction of the social, is what, by the very virtue of its grammatization, is also the one and only road towards the invention of new forms of individuation.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-32-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-32">32</a></sup> And this is the viewpoint that informs all the activities and research and development at Centre Pompidou’s Institute for Research and Innovation (IRI).</p>
			<p>However, such a position is only achievable by first operating a pharmacological critique of its objects – and that is what I shall attempt to sketch as a conclusion by stressing that the gambit of such an exercise amounts to no less than the dilemma: war or peace, and this within a phenomenon presently emerging that I call the <em>inter-nation</em>.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-33-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-33">33</a></sup></p>
			<p class="separation-dash">—</p>
			<p>If social networks are an extraordinary example of Simondon’s theory, following which one can only psychically individuate by individuating collectively, contemporary society then suffers from a social disindividuation which has liquidated what used to be called social networks – networks grounded in inter-generational, ancestral relationships. </p>
			<p>Looking through this prism, one is tempted to think we can observe the emergence – through Facebook and so many other socio-technological modes of mediations, including networked games – of non-social networks, <em>substitutes</em> for <em>true</em> social networks: <em>pharmaka</em> of social networks, ersatz, simulacra, make-believes and make-dos for the absence of social reality. They are a ‘cure’ for the lack of social relations, just as games are a relief for the social desert in which young adults live – as was well demonstrated by Thomas Gaon in the workshop <em>Desire and Technology</em> organized by Mathilde Girard at IRI.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-34-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-34">34</a></sup> One is then tempted to think that the cure these young adults administer themselves might well be worse than the disease – maybe <em>erroneously, that is, if one enquires no further</em>.</p>
			<p>Yes, it is the young adults who develop the social networks, and who find in these technologies a way to reconstitute what they miss so dearly: namely, a <em>philia</em>. But a young adult needs the gaze of another young adult, of a peer – and that is exactly what these networks provide. This is why ‘peer-to-peer’<sup><a id="footnote-294455-35-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-35">35</a></sup> has taken such a flight, and the internet is an ideal <em>medium</em> to develop such parity-based relationships. But for us at IRI, peer-to-peer has also imposed itself because nowadays youths no longer wish to be mere consumers, they want to act and to practice, and that is a good thing. They want to <em>individuate</em>, both psychically and collectively.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-36-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-36">36</a></sup></p>
			<p>It is within this general (and generous) context that we also should take notice of the fact that a social network is also a space of construction of what Freud called the ‘<em>secondary processes of identification</em>’, which normally take place within a proximity-based social network, i.e. within the <em>philia</em> constituting a device of the familial, or tribal, or clannish, or rural, or urban type, which are also political, etc.</p>
			<p>And as far as the present <em>public domain</em> is concerned – which is now by and large digitized and consists of psycho-socio-technological networks, given that all previous structures have fallen apart in the meanwhile – let us take good notice that it allows numerous young adults to break loose from the television networks. These have become, in their eyes, the stamping ground of adults, who they actually consider as <em>minors</em>, since their parents have more often than not become <em>infantilized</em> by the transformation of their psyche in a repository of ‘disposable brain-time’,<sup><a id="footnote-294455-37-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-37">37</a></sup> a situation contemporary youth wants to counter by developing its own relational, if not truly <em>social</em>, space.</p>
			<p>Why this proviso? Because I do not believe that a social <em>network</em> in general, and a socio-technological network in particular could ever be able, by itself, to foster the formation of a social group. And also because I believe that the real issue is about the <em>arrangement</em> of social <em>networks</em> with social <em>groups</em> (since a social network without a social group is equivalent to a mafia).</p>
			<p>Such an arrangement is not only possible, but also entirely believable because a socio-technological network is also a scripted space and hence a space of individuation. But in order to <em>actually</em> be possible, a socio-technological network should also be inter-generational, or, to put it more precisely: <em>a social group should constitute itself as an inter-generational arrangement of socio-psycho-technological networks</em>.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-38-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-38">38</a></sup></p>
			<p>There are all kinds of socio-technological networks, and Facebook is only one instance of them. Many of these networks have been invested by adults for the purpose of pursuing various foci of interest – ranging from professional activities to religious beliefs, and innumerable other types and forms of life experience in between. The grammatization represented by social networks is bound to take in, in its time, all forms of traditional social networks, the way immigration networks too have been connecting to socio-technological ones.</p>
			<p>We, at the Research and Innovation Institute of the Centre Pompidou, take a very political stance with respect to modern culture, and for us, this entails that we, as adults, must take up in the most attentive, but also must generous way, our responsibilities in matters of the development of socio-technological networks. They should become networks for the production of maturity and majority (<em>majorité</em>) in the Kantian sense of the word: adult networks, networks where young adults are enabled to find their path towards adulthood, transforming from minors into adults in the process, a thing that has become extremely difficult in an age where adults themselves have become so dramatically infantilized.</p>
			<p>For that, we need to create policed, meaning politicized communities of friends in the social networks.<sup><a id="footnote-294455-39-backlink" class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-294455-39">39</a></sup> These communities should be civic in the sense that they take a critical stance regarding the conditions of their individuation. This project should be conducted according to a pharmacological conception of the network, where, for instance, it should be perfectly feasible to go on the networks in order to co<a id="Anker" />unter anything on these very same networks that stands in the way of their concretization as a process of psychical, technological, and collective individuation. It is necessary to develop communities of theoretical and practical knowledge on and in the networks, to establish spaces of critique, and for this, to invent a much needed <em>political technology</em>, which requires in its turn an advanced understanding of <em>metadataware</em>, based on polemical trans-individuation technologies, and by organizing logical controversies that are at the same time peaceful, well-meaning, and based on voluntary contribution.</p>
